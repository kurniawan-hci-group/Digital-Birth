 The Lady class represents the woman in labor, and is the main implementation 
 of the data model of Digital Birth.
 
 A Lady contains a Baby object; the Baby doesn't do anything interesting
 (in this version).
 
 A Lady contains a timer (on the main run loop), that fires with a frequency
 specified by the game's game speed setting. On every tick of the timer, a number 
 of internal stats are updated, labor stage transitions are checked for, and 
 various other data model tasks are performed. See the -(void)timerTick method
 for details.
 
 Another timer schedules contractions. When the timer fires, the 
 -(void)startContraction: method is called; a Contraction is instantiated and 
 added to the currentContractions array; and the next contraction is scheduled.
 See Contraction.h for details.
 
 The Lady class also has an API for applying player actions: the 
 -(bool)eligibleForAction: and -(bool)applyAction: methods. See those
 method descriptions for details.
